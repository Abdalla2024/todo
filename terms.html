              TodoList is a personal task management application for
              iOS devices that helps users:

              providers to serve content. Your use of third-party services is

              These Terms apply to the extent permitted by the laws of your
              place of residence. If you reside in the United States, the laws
              of your state govern these Terms; otherwise, the laws of your
              country of residence apply. Mandatory consumer protections in your
              jurisdiction remain unaffected.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Severability</h2>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the
